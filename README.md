<p>
Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge for financial institutions, with
detrimental effects on both customers and businesses. Fraudulent transactions can occur due to
various factors, including unauthorized access, compromised card information, or sophisticated
cyber-attacks. Detecting fraudulent activity is crucial to safeguarding financial systems and
maintaining customer trust. Establishing robust methods to classify credit card transactions as
either legitimate or fraudulent is imperative. Utilizing Machine Learning algorithms, this
research aims to identify key features within a credit card transaction dataset that impact fraud
classification. By developing a fraud prediction framework, this study seeks to enhance the
effectiveness of fraud detection in the financial sector, ultimately contributing to the security
and integrity of electronic payment systems.
